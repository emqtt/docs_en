==========================
*EMQ* - Erlang MQTT Broker
==========================

*EMQ(Erlang MQTT Broker)* is a distributed, massively scalable, highly extensible MQTT message broker written in Erlang/OTP.

.. NOTE:: Adopt a shortened project name since 2.0 release: EMQ

*EMQ* is fully open source and licensed under the Apache Version 2.0. *EMQ* implements both MQTT V3.1 and V3.1.1 protocol specifications, and supports MQTT-SN, CoAP, WebSocket, STOMP and SockJS at the same time.

*EMQ* provides a scalable, reliable, enterprise-grade MQTT message Hub for IoT, M2M, Smart Hardware and Mobile Messaging Applications. Sensors, Mobiles, Web Browsers and Application Servers could be connected by *EMQ* brokers with asynchronous PUB/SUB MQTT messages.

The 1.0 release of the *EMQ* broker has scaled to 1.3 million concurrent MQTT connections on a 12 Core, 32G CentOS server.
